# Premise

- Evil source at bottom of playable map
- Evil is surging upwards
- Player is the one tasked with going to the bottom and destroying evil source
- Very long way to bottom
- Going deeper = main source progression
- Barriers to going deeper, gotta craft gear, etc. to be able to go deeper
- Tower defense elements, have to craft and set up defensive structures
