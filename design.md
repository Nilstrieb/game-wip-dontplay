# Premise

- Evil source at bottom of playable map
- Evil is surging upwards
- Player is the one tasked with going to the bottom and destroying evil source
- Very long way to bottom
- Going deeper = main source progression
- Barriers to going deeper, gotta craft gear, etc. to be able to go deeper
- Tower defense elements, have to craft and set up defensive structures

# Details

## Map Size

Outer core is at about a few kilometers over 100 km.
It is a liquid layer, an endless sea of extremely hot and destructive lava.
It's the end of progression, bottom of the map, can't progress further.
The evil source is somewhat above that, at about 100 km.
The final goal is the evil source, so player is expected to mine about 100 km deep to beat the game.
1 meter = one block. 100 km = 100,000 blocks deep.
