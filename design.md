# Premise

- Evil source at bottom of playable map
- Evil is surging upwards
- Player is the one tasked with going to the bottom and destroying evil source
- Very long way to bottom
- Going deeper = main source progression
- Barriers to going deeper, gotta craft gear, etc. to be able to go deeper
- Tower defense elements, have to craft and set up defensive structures

# Details

## Map Size

World is roughly 60000x60000 blocks large.
I've done some measurements and I believe it's large enough that it should convey
the scale of digging very deep, which is what the game is about.
The evil source is at about 50 km.
The final goal is the evil source, so player is expected to mine about 50 km deep to beat the game.
1 meter = one tile. 50 km = 50,000 tiles deep.
There could be some post-endgame content from 50,000-60,000 blocks deep.
Very unbreakable bottom or lava lake or whatever is at 60,000 blocks deep.

## Number of stuff

- Up to 1000 tiles (1024*1024 tile sprite sheet)
  - At least 100 ore types
  - At least 50 stone types
  - Maybe background tiles and other stuff, like different break overlay animations
